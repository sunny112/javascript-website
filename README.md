# javascript-website
A website about brand of nail polish. Include javascript, html and CSS.
1. Please download .zip to see my project, it is only an over 400kb file. 
2. This is a small project for practicing.
3. The project includes three .css files, two .js files and many .html.
4. I used javascript to write this website. It shows some dynamic results: page hightlighting, slideshow,
   showing different parts of navigation, show different picture, defecting default values and so on.
5. I will keep updating... Coming soon...
